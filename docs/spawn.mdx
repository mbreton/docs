description: 'You can use spawn to run actors. Actors created with spawn are spawning actors, and actors created with invoke are invoking actors.'

Sometimes invoking [actors](actors.mdx) may not be flexible enough for your needs. For example, you might want to:

- Invoke child machines that last across _several_ states
- Invoke a _dynamic number_ of actors

You can do this by **spawning** an actor instead of invoking. Actors created by spawning are **spawning actors**, and actors created with invoke are **invoking actors**.

There are two ways to spawn: the `spawnChild` action creator, or the `spawn` helper function for `assign`.

In most cases, prefer `spawnChild`, which causes an actor to be spawned, and can accept a configurable ID for the actor to reference it later:

```ts
createMachine({
  entry: spawnChild(childMachine, {
    id: 'child'
  })
})
```

You can use `spawnChild` for multiple spawned actors:

```ts
createMachine({
  entry: [
    spawnChild(childMachine, { id: 'child-1' }),
    spawnChild(childMachine, { id: 'child-2' }),
    spawnChild(childMachine, { id: 'child-3' })
  ]
})
```

You can also use the `spawn` helper function provided by the `assign` action creator, which allows you to store a reference to the spawned actor (an `ActorRef`) in the machine's `context`:

```ts
const parentMachine = createMachine({
  entry: [
    assign({
      childMachineRef: ({ spawn }) => spawn(childMachine, { id: 'child' })
    })
  ]
});
```

However, if you use `spawn`, **make sure you remove the ActorRef from `context` to prevent memory leaks** when the spawned actor is no longer needed:

```ts
actions: [
  stopChild('child'),
  assign({ childMachineRef: undefined })
]
```

You can `spawn` as many actors as you need:

```ts
const childMachine = createMachine({
  /* ... */
});

const parentMachine = createMachine({
  entry: [
    assign({
      childMachineRefs: ({ spawn }) => [
        // highlight-start
        spawn(childMachine),
        spawn(childMachine),
        spawn(childMachine),
        // highlight-end
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

If you donâ€™t need to keep track of a reference to the spawned actor (e.g.: for anonymous spawned actors), you can use the `spawnChild` action creator. It does _not_ return a reference, but indicates to the XState interpreter that a new actor should be spawned:

```ts
createMachine({
  entry: spawnChild('workflow', {
    id: 'workflow'
  })
})
```

## API

```ts
actions: assign({
  ref: ({ spawn }) => spawn(fromPromise(...), {
    id: 'some-id',
  })
})
```

- `spawn(actorBehavior, options?)`
  - `actorBehavior` - The behavior of the actor to spawn. This can be a function, promise, observable, or callback.
  - `options` - Options for spawning the actor.
    - `id` - The ID of the actor. This is used to reference the actor in the state machine.
    - `input`

## Source

- Inline: `spawn(fromPromise(...))`
- Referenced: `spawn('getUser')`
  - `.provide({ actors })`

## Lifecycle

- Created & started when spawned
- Stopped when the machine is stopped
- Can be manually stopped

## Stopping an actor

- `actions: stopChild('some-id')`

- Note this does not clear it from the `context`

## Spawn and TypeScript

:::typescript

**XState v5 requires TypeScript version 5.0 or greater.** 

For best results, use the latest TypeScript version. [Read more about XState and TypeScript](typescript.mdx)
